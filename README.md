> Diane, 11:31 pm. Just finished washing up and ready for bed. This
> morning, I showered for nine minutes. Found seventeen hairs; three
> curly, fourteen straight. I used the Basalm shampoo along with the
> conditioner courtesy of the hotel and delivering what it promised. A
> silky manageability. Cotton towel by Field Crest with just the right
> amount of absorbancy. Consumed fifteen doughnuts today, Diane. All
> jelly. I'll be injecting my insulin in four minutes. Diane, slept
> great last night. Got to find out what kind of sheets these are; not
> cotton, not rayon, silky. Damn fine sheets. I'm gonna get naked and
> slide around in them.
